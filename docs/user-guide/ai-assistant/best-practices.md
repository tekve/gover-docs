# AI Best Practices

Get the most out of Gover's AI Assistant with these tips.

## Writing Good Prompts

### Be Specific
❌ "Help me with compliance"
✅ "What controls should I implement for GDPR Article 32 security requirements?"

### Provide Context
❌ "Suggest mappings"
✅ "Suggest controls for the ISO 27001 A.9 Access Control requirements"

### Ask Follow-ups
Build on previous responses:
- "Can you explain that in more detail?"
- "What about for smaller organizations?"
- "Show me examples"

## Working with Suggestions

### Start with High Confidence
Accept suggestions with 80%+ confidence first, then review lower scores.

### Verify Before Accepting
Always review suggestions against your actual controls and requirements.

### Use Bulk Actions Wisely
Bulk accept only when you've reviewed the suggestions.

### Provide Feedback
Accepting and rejecting suggestions helps AI learn your preferences.

## Improving AI Quality

### Better Descriptions
Detailed control and requirement descriptions lead to better suggestions.

### Consistent Naming
Use consistent terminology across your workspace.

### More Data
AI improves as you add more controls, documents, and mappings.

### Regular Use
The more you use AI features, the better they become.

## When to Use AI

### Good Use Cases
- Initial mapping of new frameworks
- Finding gaps in coverage
- Drafting descriptions
- Exploring compliance questions

### When to Be Careful
- Final audit preparation (always verify)
- Highly specialized requirements
- Organization-specific policies

## Limitations

AI is helpful but has limitations:

| Limitation | Mitigation |
|------------|------------|
| May miss context | Provide more details |
| Can be wrong | Always verify suggestions |
| Doesn't know your org | Review against your reality |
| Generic advice | Customize for your needs |

## Privacy Reminders

- AI doesn't store your prompts
- Your data stays in your workspace
- No training on your data
- EU data residency (Sweden Central)

## Summary

1. **Be specific** in your questions
2. **Provide context** about what you're working on
3. **Review suggestions** before accepting
4. **Verify against reality** — AI isn't perfect
