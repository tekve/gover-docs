### Finding Gaps

```
You: What requirements in ISO 27001 don't have mapped controls?

AI: I found 12 requirements without mapped controls:
- A.5.1.1 - Policies for information security
- A.5.1.2 - Review of policies
...
Would you like me to suggest controls for these?
```

### Getting Suggestions

```
You: Suggest controls for A.5.1.1

AI: Based on the requirement "Policies for information security",
I recommend these controls:
1. Information Security Policy (90% match)
2. Security Policy Framework (85% match)
...
```
