## Understanding Suggestions

### Confidence Scores

Each suggestion includes a confidence score:

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 90-100% | Very high confidence |
| 70-89% | High confidence |
| 50-69% | Medium confidence |
| Below 50% | Low confidence |

### Reasoning

AI provides reasoning for each suggestion:

- Text similarity analysis
- Existing mapping patterns
- Industry best practices

## Working with Suggestions

### Accept

Click **Accept** to create the mapping.

### Reject

Click **Reject** to dismiss the suggestion.

### Modify

Accept the suggestion, then modify the mapping as needed.

### Bulk Accept

Select multiple suggestions and accept them all at once.

## Suggestion Quality

AI suggestions improve when:

- You have more existing mappings (AI learns patterns)
- Descriptions are detailed and clear
- You provide feedback by accepting/rejecting

## Best Practices

1. **Review before accepting** — AI isn't perfect
2. **Check confidence scores** — Higher is better
3. **Read the reasoning** — Understand why AI suggested it
4. **Provide feedback** — Accept/reject helps improve suggestions
5. **Start with high confidence** — Accept obvious matches first
