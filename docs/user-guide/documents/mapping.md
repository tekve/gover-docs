# Mapping Documents

Link documents to controls, tasks, and other entities as evidence.

## Why Map Documents?

Mapping creates traceability:
- Shows evidence for controls
- Links deliverables to tasks
- Supports audit requirements
- Demonstrates compliance

## Mapping to Controls

Documents serve as evidence for controls.

### From a Document

1. Open the document
2. Go to **Controls** tab
3. Click **Map Controls**
4. Select controls
5. Confirm mapping

### From a Control

1. Open the control
2. Go to **Documents** tab
3. Click **Map Documents**
4. Select documents
5. Confirm mapping

## Mapping to Tasks

Link documents as task deliverables.

1. Open the document
2. Go to **Tasks** tab
3. Click **Map Tasks**
4. Select tasks
5. Confirm mapping

## AI-Assisted Mapping

Let AI suggest document-to-control mappings:

1. Open a document
2. Click **AI Suggestions**
3. Review suggested controls
4. Accept relevant suggestions

See all entities linked to a document:
- Controls tab
- Tasks tab

### Control View
See all documents linked to a control:
- Documents tab

### Matrix View
See document-control mappings in a matrix format.

## Bulk Mapping

Map multiple documents at once:

1. Select documents in list view
2. Click **Bulk Actions** → **Map**
3. Select target controls
4. Apply to all selected

## Removing Mappings

1. Open the document or control
2. Go to the relevant tab
3. Click the remove icon on the mapping
4. Confirm removal

## Best Practices

1. **Map comprehensively** — Link all relevant evidence
2. **Use AI suggestions** — Save time finding matches
3. **Review periodically** — Update mappings as documents change
4. **Avoid over-mapping** — Only map where there's genuine relevance
5. **Document rationale** — Add notes explaining why documents support controls
