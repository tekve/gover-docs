# Control Categories

Organize your controls into logical categories for easier management.

## Why Categorize?

Categories help you:

- Find controls quickly
- Report by category
- Assign ownership by area
- Track coverage by domain

## Default Categories

Gover provides common category structures:

### By Domain

- Information Security
- Privacy and Data Protection
- Business Continuity
- Physical Security
- Human Resources

### By Type

- Technical Controls
- Administrative Controls
- Physical Controls
- Detective Controls
- Preventive Controls

## Managing Categories

### Create a Category

1. Go to **Controls** → **Settings** → **Categories**
2. Click **Add Category**
3. Enter:
   - Category name
   - Description
   - Parent category (optional)
   - Color (optional)
4. Save

### Edit Categories

1. Go to **Controls** → **Settings** → **Categories**
2. Click a category
3. Modify details
4. Save changes

### Reorder Categories

Drag and drop categories to reorder them in the sidebar and lists.

### Delete Categories

1. Select a category
2. Click **Delete**
3. Choose what to do with controls in that category:
   - Move to another category
   - Leave uncategorized

## Category Hierarchy

Create nested categories for detailed organization:

```
Security Controls
├── Access Control
│   ├── Authentication
│   └── Authorization
├── Network Security
│   ├── Firewalls
│   └── Monitoring
└── Data Security
    ├── Encryption
    └── Backup
```

## Assigning Controls to Categories

### Single Control

1. Open the control
2. Edit the **Category** field
3. Select from the dropdown
4. Save

### Bulk Assignment

1. Select multiple controls
2. Click **Bulk Actions** → **Set Category**
3. Choose a category
4. Apply

## Category Reports

Generate reports by category:

- Control count per category
- Implementation status by category
- Mapping coverage by category

## Best Practices

1. **Keep it simple** — Don't over-categorize
2. **Be consistent** — Use the same structure across the organization
3. **Align with frameworks** — Consider framework structures when categorizing
4. **Review periodically** — Categories may need adjustment as you grow
